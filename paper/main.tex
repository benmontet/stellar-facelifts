\section{Introduction}

Background here:

co-moving stars as wide binaries

wide binary components should be the same in many properties (esp. age), if they're not that's interesting: Poppenhaeger and Wolk 2014

gyrochronology: rotation + age link

rotation can be affected by HJs. we will look for this.



%\section{Asynchronous Rotation}


%Let's talk here about known HJs in wide binaries, and how many of them have faster rotation than their neighbors. We can use this to find HJs

%Show examples, if we can find one or more HJs with a wide binary companion in Kepler/K2.
%Do they also show excess flare activity?

%Let's also look at the percentage of hot jupiters with measured Prot in Kepler/K2

%This distribution is different than the field Prot observations? For what size planets/what periods?


\section{Known HJ hosts in Kepler and K2}
\subsection{Co-moving companions}

selection of HJ hosts

search for co-moving pairs

(FIGURE: error ellipses in parallax-PM space)

how many did we find?

\input{kepler_matches_table.tex}

\input{k2_matches_table.tex}


\subsection{Rotation periods of pairs}

how many of these have measurable rotation periods?

(FIGURE: multipanel example of autocorrelation functions)

are they significantly different?

(TABLE)

\subsection{Other disparate age indicators}

flaring?

Do we see any beaming signals in any of these stars? Do we xmatch with the Milholland results?

x-ray sources in GALEX?



\section{Predicting HJ hosts}
\subsection{Kepler and K2}
using rotation periods in co-moving pairs without known planets to predict spun-up hosts

quantify observations needed

this will allow us to find non-transiting HJs with known ages

\subsection{TESS}

What 2-minute cadence targets have a co-moving companion?

do some wild extrapolation to FFI stars%
